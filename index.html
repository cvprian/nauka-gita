    <h1>My Way</h1>
      <p>And now, the end is near<br>
        And so I face the final curtain<br>
My friend, I'll say it clear<br>
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain<br><br>
I've lived a life that's full<br>
I've traveled each and every highway<br>
But more, much more than this<br>
I did it my way<br><br>
Regrets, I've had a few<br>
But then again, too few to mention<br>
I did what I had to do<br>
And saw it through without exemption<br><br>
I planned each charted course<br>
Each careful step along the byway<br>
And more, much more than this<br>
I did it my way<br><br>
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew<br>
When I bit off more than I could chew<br>
But through it all, when there was doubt<br>
I ate it up and spit it out<br><br>
I faced it all and I stood tall<br>
And did it my way<br>
I've loved, I've laughed and cried<br>
I've had my fill my share of losing<br><br>
And now, as tears subside<br>
I find it all so amusing<br>
To think I did all that<br>
And may I say - not in a shy way<br><br>
Oh no, oh no, not me<br>
I did it my way<br>
For what is a man, what has he got<br>
If not himself, then he has naught<br><br>
To say the things he truly feels<br>
And not the words of one who kneels<br>
The record shows I took the blows<br>
And did it my way<br><br>
Yes, it was my way</p>
